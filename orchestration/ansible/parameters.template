# The graph set consisting of named graphs listing the

# - The host loader directory is where the graph
#   combination files are downloaded to and is different

#Â - The host db directory is the server directory that will be
#   mounted into the graph DB container to house
#   the compiled database, this is different for each db.
# - The host log directory mounted  for the graph database.
#   This can be shared.
