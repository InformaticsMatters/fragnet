# AWS variables...

# The user is expected to have defined AWS credentials on the control machine
# (the machine the playbook is run on, not the host being modified)
# and other AWS-specific environment variables, namely: -
#
# - AWS_ACCESS_KEY
# - AWS_SECRET_KEY
# - AWS_REGION
#
# We read them here to ensure that the playbook does not progress
# unless the user has been explict about the region 9especially).

# Do we wait for the graph DB before continuing?
wait_for_graph: yes
# And the time to wait for the database?
# Here, this is the time for the neo47 port (7474) to become available.
# On first deployment this can be significant, on subsequent
# restarts it's usually fast (less than a minute).

# Fragnet application variables...
# -------

# The Docker image tag for the 'squonk/fragnet-search' image.
